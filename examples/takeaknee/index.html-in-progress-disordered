  <p>Much of modern politics is about division, and trying to score points back when you feel like
the other team has scored a point against you. Finding the right messengers is both powerful
and easy way to short-circuit these divisions. Most of the sports-related messengers are pretty mild: they are standing up for the right to protest, and light on joining the original message. Still, first steps are — by far — the hard ones on crossing political lines. So start here, and then follow up with articles on racism.

<p>The mildest frame — and thus perhaps best for wavering Trump voters — is simply that some of Trump’s past supporters have had enough, and that people whose first loyalty is to sports are unhappy with Trump right now. For liberals this doesn’t feel on-point, but it is likely a powerful place to start, a powerful place to lower the boundaries that get in the way of saners conversations and saner votes.

<p>It’s good to be up front: these unity messages are not Kaepernick’s original message, which is getting lost, and if you have an idea that can pull support away from Trump as much as sports teams unifying against him, and at the same time get Kaepernick’s message out, please share it. 

These messengers may
be an opening, a first step, in an environment where usually no progress is made.

these are the opening that is required to make Trump’s divisive distractions backfire, creating space for the real message if anything can. Start with these anti-trolling social media posts to create space, then go back to the voices of the original protest.
</p>
<p>Note that there are three very different voices recommended here. Let messengers and witnesses speak for themselves, without adding your voice. When Trump commits an outrage, when he is trolling, 
speak with, for and as everyone — isolate him, don't let him represent conservatives against the left. When it is time for you to speak, stick to your frame, without saying "no" or

If someone is upset that kneeling is disrespectful, acknowledge that, say you don’t find it so but see why they might — avoid that rabbit hole. Then ask or share something back on track, such as how do they think athletes should protest racism instead.</p>

    better than the average political online conversation. Go slow but move forward!</p>

<p class="see4">The <a href="http://cognitivepolitics.org/social-media-guide-progressives">Progressive Guide to Social Media</a> aims to teach many principles of framing, nonviolent communication, radical civility, and other ways to improve your social media. From the guide, we're developing issue-by-issue examples. The examples are the "how," the guide explains the why. The guide is intended to educate, and the example pages like this one provide resources that you can share with moderate and conservative friends in your social circles.</p> 

<p>These guides are produced rather informally by people at <a href="http://cognitivepolitics.org">Cognitive Politics: a Communications Workbook for Progressives</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SocialMediaApproachesforRespectandTolerance/">Social Media Approaches for Respect and Tolerance</a> and we'd love for you to get involved!

    <li class="see"><h3>Plan:: Audience:: Outrage/Trolling</h3></li>
<p>
    <p>This story starts like many others: someone (Colin Kaepernick) is trying to get us to talk about racism, and Trump jumps in with something outrageous — Trump is trying to troll us, that is to put bait on a hook and get us to bite, arguing about the wrong thing, worsening rather than bridging the divisions in our society. Kaepernick said he is against police brutality and racism. He took steps to respect soldiers: kneeling, not sitting, specifically to show respect. And Trump came by and made it about Trump and patriotism. Plan: isolating trolls means not taking the bait, staying in your frame, and countering them for their misbehavior from a centrist position. See Tension: Isolating Trolls and Keeping Your Voice. instead isolate the trolls. Isolate the troll-in-chief! (PS: Trolling is a technique. Don't take the bait — learn counter-techinques. Calling Trump a troll to his supporters is not an effective counter-technique.)

    <li class="see3"><h3>Plan:: Audience:: Segmentation & Goals</h3>

<p class="see2">Not left -vs- right, but Trump vs sports, Trump vs everyone.</p>
<p>1) Patriotism issues:: For people who aren’t near-allies already, how can we leverage this so that Trump’s effort to divide us backfires? I think the answer is mostly clear, and may work very well: carefully avoid making this about leftist protestors -vs- everyone. Make it sports (everyone) -vs- just Trump. Frame {conversation frame}: this is an issue where Trump supporters are abandoning him. How to is easy: help articles of sports stars abandoning Trump go viral. Leverage: Lots! This could backfire very badly, with loyalty to sports leveraged against loyalty to Trump — it might remove some of loyalty-as-obstacle that has stymied past conversations.  <div class="leverage">Leverage: high! This could backfire very badly, with loyalty to sports leveraged against loyalty to Trump. Facts don't work when we feel like we are on different teams, and this could help us feel like we are one team.</div></p>

<p>2) Police brutality and racism:: Once the argument about patriotism is out of the way (quite a challenge) this may be an opportunity to talk about racism. Or, it may not be a good opening. I haven’t seen much talk about police brutality coming from the current fracas. But we should look for ways to get back to the real issues to the extent we can. <div class="leverage">Leverage: not much.</div></p>

<p>3) Active listening / Steelman Argument from the right: Not-troll conservatives are often describing a desire that we get along better, that we stop being divided as a country. I think this is something we can agree with; it could be a powerful moment for that. <div class="leverage">Leverage: we have been desperate for unity. Now conservatives are feeling that too.</div> Remember that their media is trying to hype this up and maximize the conflict, so they’re reading a lot from that perspective. Agree with this part! Make this the “Yes, and …” part, and share that Kaepernick chose to kneel rather than sit in order to be respectful, and ask why and when this went from Kaepernick and one other player very quietly expressing themselves and became a national issue. Did Kaepernick curse anyone out, or make a stink? What did he do, when did he do it, that was actually offensive to anyone not looking to be offended?</p>
    </li>
    <li class="see"><h3>Frame: About Racism, Not About Patriotism</h3>

<p>This divides partly into whether you are trying to initiate a conversation one on one, where
the best approach is to take Trump out of the equation and patriotism out of the equation, if you can, and just talk about racism. Anything else will likely backfire.

<p>Or engaging in social media. For many activists, we first looked at this and said something like, "football, whatever." But if we're looking at voters who might or might stand behind Trump, focusing on the conflict in loyalties between sports heroes and Trump might move loyalties that have been locked in place. It's important, in this case, not to frame this as liberals -vs- conservatives including Trump, but football -vs- Trump (alone). Trump is using divisive tactics, pulling the attention off the issues that was Kaepernick's frame. We can't just wish that this wasn't so: we have to make Trump's tactic backfire. 

<p>When you are posting in situations like this, post messengers rather than your own words. There are two frames, and two categories of messengers: post football players and other messengers upset with Trump's bullying ways, and post Kaepernick and allies thoughts on why they started this.

(Note: I wouldn't contradict if a veteran or soldier speaks for themselves. But when someone like Trump speaks for others,
it's good to counter from a centrist position.)

      <p>Many decent conservatives are upset that "their side" is led by Trump. Give them exposure
      to voices "on their side" who see Trump for what he is, for example <a href="https://twitter.com/Evan_McMullin/status/911926608486834177">follow Evan McMullin on twitter.</a> Note: if liberals
take the spotlight from Trump, and instead post civil disagreements with McMullin, that creates
space for conservatives to defend a more decent conservative — possibly the biggest threat to 
Trump and long-term Trump politics.</p>
