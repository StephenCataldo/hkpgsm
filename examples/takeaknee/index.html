  <h2>Prepare for Outrage Trolling</h2>
  <p class="see3x">Someone talks about racism, and Trump jumps in with something outrageous to distract and tribalize. What's your frame?</p>
  <div class="see3">
  	<h3 class="see4">Plan:: Outrage/Trolling</h3>
	
	
  	<p>This story starts like many others: someone (Colin Kaepernick) is trying to get us to talk about racism, and Trump jumps in with something outrageous, designed to distract and tribalize. Isolating trolls means not taking the bait, instead countering them for their misbehavior from a centrist position that isolates them. See <a href="">Tension: Isolating Trolls and Keeping Your Voice.</a>
  
	<p>PS: Trolling is a technique. Fishing with outrages designed to get the left to react in a way that loses votes. Don't take the bait &mdash; <a href="http://cognitivepolitics.org/social-media-guide-progressives#outrage">learn counter-techinques.</a> But calling Trump a troll to his supporters is not an effective counter-technique. 

  	<p>This leaves us with split goals: cost Trump voter loyalty for trolling, 
and get the national conversation to engage racism and police 
brutality/professionalism. <a href="http://cognitivepolitics.org/issues/takeaknee">-more-</a>

    <h3>Audience Frame: "Trump vs Unity"</h3>

    <p>To make this a learning moment on racism, we have to open the door 
    first.
    If there are two sides here, it's vital that we not frame it as left -vs- right, 
    reinforcing Trump's implied message that white conservatives, veterans and
    rural working class people don't have to care about racism. Instead,
    make it Trump vs sports, Trump vs everyone. Set the conversation as
    Trump trolling the entire nation, and <em>then</em> talk about more serious
    issues on racism.</p>

    <h3>Active Listening: Patriotism and Unity</h3> 
 
 
 
    <p>Amidst this fracas, moderates and non-troll conservatives are often describing a desire that we get along better, that we stop being divided as a country. I think this is something we can agree with; it could be a powerful moment for that. Share that you feel the same way to help open conversations. 

	<p>Remember that their media is trying to hype this up and maximize the conflict, so they’re reading a lot from that perspective. Make this the “Yes, and …” part, and share that Kaepernick chose to kneel rather than sit in order to be respectful. Ask why and when this went from Kaepernick and one other player very quietly expressing themselves and became a national issue. Did Kaepernick curse anyone out, or make a stink? What did he do, when did he do it, that wasn't merely a small disagreement but an issue worth tearing the
country apart over? If he believes that racism and police brutality are major issues, how should he give voice to that? </p>

    <p>Many moderates and less political voters are upset that our country is dividing. Who they blame for that division might well decide the next elections. Trump is trying to divide Americans, distracting us from real issues of racism and distracting us from everything else: how can we make that backfire? 

    <p><div class="leverage">Dialogue Leverage: we have been desperate for unity. Now conservatives are feeling that too. Start conversations.</div>

<p>We need to carefully avoid making this about leftist protestors -vs- everyone. Make it sports (everyone) -vs- just Trump. Frame the
conversation as everyone against Trump, not left against right; as an issue where Trump supporters are abandoning him. How to is easy:
help articles of sports stars abanding Trump go viral.

	Learn more: Steelman Arguments

	<h3>Goals, Audience and Leverage</h3>
	
	<p>Have you seen another issue where conservative-leaning white men who voted for
	Trump are modeling standing up to him? I can't think of one. I think the electoral
	leverage of "sports-vs-Trump" is very high, and help might clear out some of the
	cognitive bias we have been drowning in this year: Facts don't work when we feel like 
	we are on different teams, and this could help us feel like we are one team.

	<p><div class="leverage">Electoral Leverage: high! This could backfire very badly for Trump, with loyalty to sports leveraged against loyalty to Trump. </div></p>

    <h4>2) Police brutality and racism</h4> 

    <p>Kaepernick taking a knee, by itself, isn't an observation of racism. Not 
    surprisingly this makes it hard to stay the topic we wish America would focus on.
<p>Once the argument about patriotism is out of the way (quite a challenge) this may be an opportunity to talk about racism. Or, it may not be a good opening. I haven’t seen much talk about police brutality coming from the current fracas. But we should look for ways to get back to the real issues to the extent we can. 

	<p><div class="leverage">Electoral Leverage: low. Hard to be heard at this time. Kaepernick taking a knee is not a strong example of racism, which is (not suprisingly) a better place to start that conversation. Please share ideas that seem to work. <a href="#observation-racism">We did find one good example that fits this conversation.</a>.</div></p>

	<p class="warning">Standard Simplicity Warning: Talk about patriotism or racism in any one conversation; not both! Mixing these conversations is how the trolls win. Post football players and other messengers upset with Trump's bullying ways, and post Kaepernick and allies thoughts on why they started this: but don't expect one conversation to engage both issues, and don't expect people to hear conversations about racism until you open the door by disarming the landmines about patriotism.</p>

    <h3 class="see4">Messengers! (<a href="http://cognitivepolitics.org/techniques/messengers">definition</a>)</h3>
 	<p class="see4">Much of modern politics is about division.
  	Finding the right messengers is an
  	and easy way to short-circuit these divisions. Most of the sports-related messengers are pretty mild: they are standing up for the right to protest, and light on joining the original message. Still, first steps are usually the hard ones. So start here, and then follow up with articles on racism.

  	<p class="see4">The mildest frame &mdash; and thus perhaps best for wavering Trump voters &mdash; is simply that some of Trump’s past supporters have had enough. 

  	<p class="see4">Sports-lovers who voted for Trump are unhappy, feeling their loyalties torn. Many people care about sports
much more than politics. For left-leaning activists this doesn’t feel important, but it might be more leverage than we almost ever
have.  A powerful <em>starting</em> place to lower the boundaries that get in the way of saners conversations and saner votes.</p>

  	  <p class="see4">It’s good to be up front: these unity messages are not Kaepernick’s original message, which is getting lost, and if you have an idea that can pull support away from Trump as much as sports teams unifying against him, and at the same time get Kaepernick’s message out, please share it. These messengers may
  be an opening, a first step, in an environment where usually no progress is made.</p>

  	  <h3 class="see4">Observations</h3>
  	</div>
  	
    <p>Messengers help open doors, and deal with controversy. Another type of post to start with is to simply describe your view or a straightforward <strong>observation,</strong> without arguing. Very often, messengers are chosen from the demographic you're trying to reach; the best observations spread the voices of those directly impacted. Here's an exmample: <a href="https://twitter.com/imnottayediggs/status/911731686710370304">To be clear #TakeAKnee is about protesting institutionalized racism...</a></p> 
  	
    <p class="see4" id="observation-racism">Share plain, non-editorial observations of the racism that #takeaknee is protesting, or share messengers
      favored by conservatives, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/us/air-force-academy-racial-slurs.html?_r=1">Air Force Academy deals with horrible racism in the right way.</a></p>  
    <p class="see4">We talk about fake news, privilege and filter bubbles a lot, but then forget that it is real. 
      Many white people really don't know how bad racism is. Yeah, it's lazy, sloppy, they have no good excuse... but
      this is politics, so pay attention to the bad excuses.  </p>

  <h2>Communication &mdash; 1:1 Dialogue</h2>
  <p>Start with asking, then listen, reflect, answer, and share.
  <a href="">-more resources, openings, and questions for dialogue.-</a></p>
  
  <div class="see3">	
  	<p class="see3">Radical civility, Nonviolent Communication, Powerful NonDefensive Communication and many other approaches can lead to surprising openings and connections.

community that practices and teaches radical civility.</a></p>
  
  	<h3>Emphasize areas of agreement for openings</h3>
	<p class="see3">Most Americans are agreed that we do not want police brutality and racism. We disagree about whether this is a rare bad apple or a systemic problem, what to do about it, and how to solve it.</p>
  
  	<h3>Listening: Get Conversations back on track.</h3>
  	<p class="see3">This started with a frame of engaging racism, thrown off track by mostly by Trump. So, if someone is upset that kneeling is disrespectful, acknowledge that, say you don’t find it so but see why they might &mdash; avoid that rabbit hole. Then ask or share something back on track, such as how do they think athletes should protest racism instead.</p>
  	
    <h3>What questions help open this conversation up?<h3>
	<p>Here is the BLM policy platform. Experiment with asking specific questions:
which of these policies would be helpful?   https://policy.m4bl.org/end-war-on-black-people/

	<p class="see3">Look for open questions: "What would it be like if you thought you had to talk to your kids like black parents have to warn theirs?" 
	
	<h3>Make specific requests. (NVC technique)</h3>
    <p class="see3">Watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5895028/">13th</a> together, a documentary about the prison system that includes conservative voices. Note that changing minds in online conversations is quite rare. Having a calm conversation that ends with a "maybe" about watching a documentary together, even if that never happens, is one thousand times better than the average political online conversation. Go slow but move forward!</p>
